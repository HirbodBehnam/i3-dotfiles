# My dotfiles for i3 window manager

## Font
I used Roboto Mono Nerd Font from [this link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.0.2/RobotoMono.zip) for my terminal. You have to extract the ttf files to `~/.fonts`.

## Rofi
You also need Rofi and Papirus icon pack which are found in apt.
